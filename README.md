##Use coderunner to run the code
<hr>

In this project, I will break down the login/registration into several parts:

- Login
- Register
- Prompt
- BasicUI
- CodeRunner

There are a total of 5 currently, and I will add more

**NOTE: YOU ALSO HAVE TO INSTALL THESE DEPENDENCIES AND SOFTWARE in order to run the file**
- mysql-connector-java-8.0.30.jar
- XAMPP with your own localhost


1) For mysql, just add it into your dependencies
2) For xampp, once you've installed it. Start apache and mysql. use your own localhost, username and password. You need to modify it on login and register file
