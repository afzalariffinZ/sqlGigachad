##Use coderunner to run the code
<hr>

In this project, I will break down the login/registration into several parts:

- Login
- Register
- Prompt
- BasicUI
- CodeRunner

There are a total of 5 currently, and I will add more

**NOTE: YOU ALSO HAVE TO INSTALL
- mysql-connector-java-8.0.30.jar
- XAMPP with your own localhost
in order to run the file**
